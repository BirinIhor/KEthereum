KEthereum
=========

This is a Kotlin library for [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org).
Currently it just holds some models and values to share between different projects (Android & Backend). Mainly in the context of the [WALLETH Project](http://walleth.org)
Later I could imagine that this extends to a real node implementation of Ethereum in Kotlin. But as this would be a huge endavour and I want to continue with my projects don't expect this to early - but I accept PRs ;-)
On the way to the real node implementation in the bit less distant future I could Imagine functions to deal with keys.
